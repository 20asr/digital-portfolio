```{tab-item} Things I Learned
- I learned how to operate off of the terminal and more on file explorer.
- I learned how to interpert unclear instructions through deduction.
- I learned what the format of a jupyter book looks after it is built.
```

```{tab-item} Things I Found Difficult
- I found it difficult to understand the instructions in several places such as step 7.
- I found that working on an Md file can get difficult as it will not always output exactly what it will look like. This holds true especially for nested commands. 
- I found that nested commands in an Md file results in the code taking on the format of the outermost command.
